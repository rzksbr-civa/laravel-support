# Webaune Support

**Common** support helpers, contracts, and traits required by various Webaune packages. Validator functionality, and basic controller included out-of-the-box.

> **Note:** this package is just a support package for other Webaune packages, which may not be useful on it's own, but contains some complementary generic functionality and also may not respect SemVer and break backward compatibility.


## Installation

Install via `composer require webaune/laravel-support`


## Usage

### `mimetypes()` helper

The `mimetypes` method gets valid mime types:
```php
$mimetypes = mimetypes();
```

### `timezones()` helper

The `timezones` method gets valid timezones:
```php
$timezones = timezones();
```

### unique_with Validator Rule

This feature contains a variant of the `validateUnique` rule for Laravel, that allows for validation of multi-column UNIQUE indexes.

It was forked and merged from the awesome [felixkiss/uniquewith-validator](https://github.com/felixkiss/uniquewith-validator) package, which at the time been outdated and un-maintained for a long time. Many thanks to core contributors for developing this.
